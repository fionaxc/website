    <h2 style="margin-bottom:15px; text-align:center;">Sreeram (Ram) Dhurjaty: Morphing Smartphones Into 
    Rudimentary Medical Devices for Low and Middle Income Countries</h2>
    <h4 style="margin-bottom:15px;"> With the advent of smartphones as well as low cost platforms 
        such as Arduinos/Raspberry Pi can enable morphing of these into rudimentary medical devices 
        that can enable diagnosis as well as Telemedicine. A smartphone is a powerful display 
        and computing and storage platform. Even simple smartphones have capabilities exceeding 
        all the computers in NASA in 1969, when the first moon-landing took place. This talk will 
        discuss morphing smartphones into rudimentary medical devices. Dr. Dhurjaty will also 
        mention work that has been done by several contributors, in this arena. </h4>
    <h4 style="margin-bottom:15px;"> Machine learning algorithms can enable remote diagnosis 
        and screening of ailments, that can augment the lack of of trained medical personnel in LMICs.</h4> 
    <h4 style="margin-bottom:15px;"> Appropriate technology for LMICs has to be dealt with care. 
        Patient safety and robustness cannot be compromised. Dr. Dhurjaty will touch on some of 
        the standards that govern these devices that deal with safety and performance.</h4>

    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:15px;"> Dr. Sreeram (Ram) Dhurjaty, LSMIEEE, is Chair, IEEE 
        Rochester section and a Distinguished IEEE CESoc. lecturer.  He held senior positions in engineering 
        and research, in medical systems, at Eastman Kodak Company, Analogic, and Bose Corporation 
        before embarking on a career of full time consulting. He was educated at IIT Bombay 
        and Yale University and has degrees in Civil Engineering, Fluid mechanics, 
        Electronic Instrumentation, Biomedical Engineering, and Control System Theory. Over his career 
        he has designed medical systems such as Patient Monitors, Defibrillators, CT scanners, 
        Ultrasound Imaging Systems, Fetal Monitoring systems, Digital and Computed Radiography, 
        Telemedicine, Telerehabilitation and precision analog circuitry for medical systems. 
        Six of his patents, at Kodak, on retrofittable digital radiography, that replaced screen film, 
        enabled a game changer in the field and a multi-billion dollar industry, worldwide.</p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:70px;"> He has 16 issued patents in areas of medical 
        devices and systems. He is passionate about affordable medical systems for Low and Middle 
        Income countries. He works closely with the Engineering World Health organization 
        (EWH) developing medical devices for under-developed countries and is a member of the 
        Board for the EWH organization. Ram developed a hand cranked defibrillator which was 
        to be marketed, initially, in India. He is an expert in low noise Analog design 
        as well high voltage magnetics. He consults in High Voltage transformer and design of 
        X-Ray generators. Ram is a member of the AAMI standards committees on Defibrillators 
        and ECGs. He is been a past-chair of the Boston chapter of the IEEE, 
        EMBS, a founding member of the IEEE, SSIT and a past representative to the IEEE, Committee 
        on Man and Radiation (COMAR). He is an emeritus member of AAPM. </p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:15px; text-align:center;">Clarice Aiello: From Nanotech to 
        Living Sensors: Unraveling the Spin Physics of Biosensing at the Nanoscale </h2>
    <h4 style="margin-bottom:15px;"> I am a quantum engineer interested in how quantum physics 
        informs biology at the nanoscale. An expert on high-tech sensors that work due to 
        room-temperature quantum effects in noisy environments, I now focus on 
        “living quantum sensors” -- organisms and cells  responding to tiny stimuli, 
        and outperforming technological probes in awe-inspiring ways. Unveiling the 
        underlying physical mechanisms employed by “living quantum sensors” impacts: 
        the engineering of ultrasensitive electromagnetic probes; the elucidation of 
        natural feats such as animal navigation; and therapeutics for metabolic diseases. 
        Can quantum physics be established -- or refuted! -- to account for physiologically 
        relevant biosensing phenomena, and be manipulated to technological and therapeutical 
        advantage? This is the exciting question that the Quantum Biology Tech (QuBiT) 
        Lab at UCLA addresses.</h4>
    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:15px;"> 
        Clarice D. Aiello was born and raised in Brazil. She trained as an experimental physicist 
        in Europe, having earned a Diplome d’Ingenieur de l’Ecole Polytechnique in France, 
        and an M.Phil. from the University of Cambridge, Trinity College, in England. </p>

    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:15px;"> 
        Research brought Clarice to the American shore, where she completed a Ph.D. in 
        Electrical Engineering at MIT. Clarice then held postdoctoral appointments in 
        Bioengineering at Stanford, and in Chemistry at UC Berkeley. Her work has been 
        funded by sources as diverse as the Fulbright Commission, the Schlumberger Foundation, 
        the Moore Foundation and UNESCO. Clarice is also a recipient of MIT’s School of 
        Engineering’s “Graduate Student Award for Extraordinary Teaching and Mentoring”.</p>
            
    <p style="font-size:14px;"> 
        Clarice is now Assist. Prof. in the Electrical and Computing Engineering Dept. 
        at UCLA, where she fearlessly leads the interdisciplinary Quantum Biology Tech (QuBiT) Lab. </p>
